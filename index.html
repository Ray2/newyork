            New York, often called New York City or simply NYC, 
is the most populous city in the United States,
located at the southern tip of New York State on one 
of the world's largest natural harbors. The city 
comprises five boroughs, each of which is 
coextensive with a respective county. It is a global 
city and a cultural, financial, high-tech, 
entertainment, and media center with a significant 
influence on commerce, health care, scientific 
output, life sciences, research, technology, 
education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, 
and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United 
Nations, New York is an important center for 
international diplomacy, and is sometimes 
described as the world's most important city and 
the capital of the world.
